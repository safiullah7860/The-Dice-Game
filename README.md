# The-Dice-Game
Users roll the dice for as long as they want, and this adds to their 'currrent score'. When they decide to 'hold,' the current score adds on to their total score.

This game has two rules;=:
  1. If user1's dice rolled is 1, then it is user2's turn and user1's current score is cleared. 
  2. If any user's total score reaches 20 or higher, they win the game
